Absolutely! Here's the Jira ticket in the same structured format as earlier, with **Problem**, **Objective**, and **Action Plan**:

---

### **Title**: Monitor Disk Space Usage and Index Fragmentation on Dev SQL Server

---

### **Problem**

1. SQL Server storage volumes (DATA, LOG, TEMPDB, BACKUPS) are not actively monitored for space utilization, leading to unplanned outages and reactive interventions.
2. Index fragmentation grows unchecked over time, degrading query performance and causing excessive I/O.
3. Lack of historical tracking for fragmentation and disk space trends prevents data-driven tuning and capacity planning.

---

### **Objective**

Implement an automated monitoring solution to:

* Track disk space usage on all SQL Server–attached volumes.
* Monitor index fragmentation levels across user databases.
* Provide proactive alerts and generate actionable performance maintenance reports.

---

### **Action Plan**

#### **Disk Space Monitoring**

* Query mounted volumes using `sys.dm_os_volume_stats`, `xp_fixeddrives`, or PowerShell `Get-PSDrive` and `Get-Volume`.
* Build a SQL Agent Job or scheduled PowerShell script to log disk usage daily into a custom table: `dbo.DiskSpaceAudit`.
* Define disk space thresholds (e.g., alert at <20% free).
* Use Database Mail to send alerts to DBAs and IT Ops when thresholds are breached.
* (Optional) Integrate with monitoring solutions such as SCOM, Grafana, Zabbix, or Prometheus exporters.

#### **Index Fragmentation Monitoring**

* Run a weekly scan using `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats` for all online user databases.
* Log results to a new table: `dbo.IndexFragmentationStats`.
* Define fragmentation thresholds:

  * 10–30% → Recommend Reorganize
  * > 30% → Recommend Rebuild
* Generate and store a maintenance recommendation report.
* Schedule a lightweight summary email to DBAs with actionable insights.

#### **Historical Trend Tracking**

* Implement rolling data retention (e.g., keep 30 days of disk stats, 90 days of fragmentation data).
* Develop lightweight Power BI or SSRS dashboards (optional) to visualize trends in disk growth and index health.

Let me know if you want the monitoring scripts for disk usage and fragmentation added to this ticket.
