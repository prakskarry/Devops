I would like to summarize the recent events and findings related to the performance issue observed in Database X for proper documentation and future reference.

As discussed earlier, when the performance degradation was initially reported, I had recommended that any index changes—especially replicating all indexes from Database Y—should first be tested in a lower environment. My concern was that, although Database X and Y share the same schema, their data distribution, workload characteristics, and transaction patterns differ. These differences can cause index effectiveness to vary between environments.

Despite this, during the joint meeting with the Development and Release teams, it was decided to proceed with creating the same set of indexes in the production environment based on prior experience. The indexes were created accordingly; however, the performance issue persists post-implementation.

Upon reviewing the current workload and query execution patterns, it appears that the newly added indexes have not contributed to query optimization and in some cases may be adding overhead due to increased maintenance during write operations.

To move forward effectively, I recommend the following:

Rollback or disable non-beneficial indexes after validation through query plan analysis.

Perform controlled testing in a lower environment before applying any further indexing or structural changes.

Conduct a comprehensive performance review focusing on data growth, parameter sniffing, and query tuning opportunities.

This note is being shared to maintain transparency on the actions taken and to ensure that future performance optimizations follow a data-driven and tested approach before deployment to production.
