1. Legacy Database Cleanup
Objective: Decommission unused or obsolete databases to reduce storage overhead and improve performance.

Action Plan:

Inventory all user databases on the dev server via sys.databases.

Capture last access time using Extended Events, default trace, or DMVs like sys.dm_exec_sessions and sys.dm_exec_requests.

Prepare a list of databases with no activity for over 90 days.

Engage dev teams to validate business usage; log confirmations.

Backup (full) each unused database and store in cold/archive tier.

Drop or detach obsolete databases after sign-off and audit trail.

Update CMDB and documentation post-deletion.

2. Data Archival Strategy for Transactional Tables
Objective: Implement partitioned archiving or historical data offloading to enhance query performance and maintain data hygiene.

Action Plan:

Identify high-churn transactional tables using sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats and row count deltas over time.

Define archival criteria (e.g., records older than 6 months).

Create staging archive tables with matching schema in a separate archival database or filegroup.

Use INSERT INTO archive_table SELECT ... with batch processing (e.g., 10K rows per batch with WAITFOR DELAY) to avoid blocking.

Implement Table Partitioning and use SWITCH for seamless data movement, if supported.

Schedule archival via SQL Agent Job or Azure Data Factory (if hybrid).

Validate referential integrity and implement soft deletes or triggers if needed.

3. Transaction Log Backup and Regular Shrinking
Objective: Prevent transaction log bloating and maintain log file health.

Action Plan:

Ensure database recovery model is set to FULL for all mission-critical databases.

Implement transaction log backups every 15 minutes using SQL Agent or Ola Hallengrenâ€™s MaintenanceSolution.

Monitor log space usage using DBCC SQLPERF(logspace).

Identify VLF fragmentation using DBCC LOGINFO.

Automate log file shrinking only post-backup and only for bloated logs, avoiding frequent shrink operations (DBCC SHRINKFILE with target size).

Document backup retention and offload policies.

4. Index Maintenance Plan
Objective: Optimize index structure for performance tuning and statistics accuracy.

Action Plan:

Use scripts like Ola Hallengren's IndexOptimize or customized PowerShell routines.

Identify fragmented indexes using sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (FRAGMENTATION > 30%).

Rebuild indexes with ONLINE = ON (Enterprise Edition) or Reorganize for mid-level fragmentation.

Update statistics with full scan (UPDATE STATISTICS WITH FULLSCAN) weekly or post-index ops.

Schedule during off-peak hours via SQL Agent Jobs.

Track index usage with sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats and drop unused indexes after analysis.

Implement reporting on index maintenance history and fragmentation trends.

5. Add New Disk for Log Backups
Objective: Isolate transaction log backups on a dedicated volume to improve IO throughput and backup management.

Action Plan:

Provision new disk (e.g., E:\ or L:) with NTFS and 64K allocation unit size.

Update SQL Server backup jobs to point to the new path (e.g., E:\SQLBackups\Logs\).

Verify SQL Server service account permissions on new volume.

Update backup retention policies to purge older files (e.g., 14 days) using PowerShell scripts or Maintenance Plans.

Monitor disk IO via PerfMon counters: PhysicalDisk: Avg. Disk sec/Write.

Tag volume in monitoring tools for alerts on space thresholds (<20%).
