Hi Team,

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the governance and maintainability of database objects (stored procedures, triggers, views, etc.), we are evaluating tools and processes for versioning and change tracking, especially for changes made through SSMS and DBeaver.

Before further researching an approach, I‚Äôd appreciate your input to help us understand:

 - Current workflows and challenges

- Expectations around Git/Bitbucket integration

- Any constraints around tools, automation, and budget

Please take a few minutes to review and respond to the following.

What types of DB objects do you typically modify? (e.g., SPs, triggers, views)
How frequently do these changes occur? (Ad-Hoc/Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
What is the purpose of version control? (Tracking, rollback, compliance, CI/CD, etc.)

Who in your team usually modifies these DB objects? (Dev, BA, DBA, etc.)

üîπ Section 2: Workflow & Practices
How are changes made today? (Directly in SSMS or DBeaver, or through .sql files?)

Are changes stored in Bitbucket or any Git repo currently?

Are shared SQL logins used? If yes, how do you identify who made the change?

Should SSMS/DBeaver changes be automatically detected and versioned?

üîπ Section 3: Git Integration
Which Git platform are you using? (Bitbucket, GitHub, etc.)

How comfortable is the team with Git commands or using Git GUIs?

Would you prefer automated Git commits or manual approval before commit?

Is rollback capability needed? If yes, for all or only some environments?

Is CI/CD integration expected now or in the near future?

üîπ Section 4: Audit & Change Tracking
Should we track who made changes (especially with shared logins)?

Should all changes (even if not committed to Git) be logged?

Do you want notifications (Email/Slack) when changes are made?

üí∞ Section 5: Budget & Licensing
Is there a budget allocated for tools (e.g., Redgate, ApexSQL)?

Preferred pricing model? (Per-user / Subscription / Free/Open-source)

Approximate number of users requiring access?

Any vendor restrictions or procurement guidelines?

Are you open to a script-based solution if setup is handled internally?

üß© Section 6: Tool Compatibility (SSMS, DBeaver, Others)
Are any team members using tools other than SSMS (e.g., DBeaver, Azure Data Studio)?

If yes, please specify which tool(s): ___________

Should the versioning solution work across both SSMS and non-Microsoft tools (like DBeaver)?

 Yes ‚Äì tool must be cross-platform

 No ‚Äì SSMS-only is acceptable

Are DBeaver users comfortable manually saving and pushing SQL object scripts to Git?

 Yes

 No

 Only if clear documentation is provided

üß≠ Optional: Describe Your Ideal Workflow
If possible, describe how you'd like this to work.
Example:

‚ÄúWhen someone alters a stored procedure in SSMS or DBeaver, it should auto-detect the change, script it out, and push the .sql file to Bitbucket with username and timestamp. Rollback support is preferred.‚Äù

Your answer:

Your input will help us choose the most effective and compatible solution ‚Äî whether a GUI-based tool (Redgate/ApexSQL), cross-platform open-source solution (Flyway/Liquibase), or an internally automated DDL-trigger-based approach.
