I hope you are doing well. I would like to provide a brief summary of the recent activities and current observations regarding the performance issue on Database X, to ensure alignment and transparency across all teams.

When the performance concern was initially raised, I had suggested that any new index implementations—particularly replicating indexes from Database Y—should first be tested in a lower environment. This recommendation was based on the fact that, while Database X and Y have the same schema, their data volume, distribution, and transaction patterns differ, which can significantly influence index effectiveness.

During our joint discussion with the Development and Release teams, it was collectively agreed to proceed with creating the same set of indexes on the production environment, considering that a similar approach had worked in the past. The changes were implemented accordingly; however, we have observed that the performance issue still persists post-deployment.

A preliminary review indicates that the newly added indexes have not produced the expected performance gains and, in some cases, may be introducing additional overhead. To ensure a more sustainable resolution, I would like to propose the following next steps:

Evaluate the impact of each newly created index using actual workload statistics and query plans.

Remove or disable non-performing indexes after validation in a controlled setup.

Conduct structured testing in lower environments for any future index or structural changes before production rollout.

Review application query patterns and parameter sniffing issues that may be contributing to latency.

This summary is shared only to maintain full clarity on the sequence of decisions and outcomes so that we can collectively refine our approach going forward. I remain available to assist with detailed analysis and to support the next round of performance tuning.
